## Brief Description

This is a web application for recording your personal notes. You can add, delete and search for matching characters.

A project created to acquire new skills and abilities.

**Note: The first index.html is a dummy page that simply sends you to the real one(made for posting on GitHub Pages because the real index.html is placed in a subfolder).**

**Note: When you go to GitHub Pages, when you add the first note, you need to reload the page. In the future, everything will work well. This was not the case during development and testing, perhaps this bug is due to the fact that the web program is hosted on GitHub Pages and it is somehow connected with it. I did not find a solution.**
