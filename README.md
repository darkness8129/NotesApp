## Brief Description

This is a web application for recording your personal notes. You can add, delete and search for matching characters.

A project created to acquire new skills and abilities.

**Note: When you go to GitHub Pages, when you add the first note, you need to reload the page. In the future, everything will work well. This was not the case during development and testing, perhaps this bug is due to the fact that the web program is hosted on GitHub Pages and it is somehow connected with it. I did not find a solution.**
